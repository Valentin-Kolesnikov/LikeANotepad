# List Builder (Main & Additional Info)

This is a simple Python script that interactively collects and displays a list of entries from the user. It supports two modes:
- Main Info Only
- Main + Additional Info

Ideal for quickly gathering structured data from user input.  

## Important clarification!!!  

The `.exe` file does not have viruses. It was created for convenience. I made this file thanks to `python -m PyInstaller --onefile ...`. If you do not trust the `.exe` file, I recommend you to use the `.py` file.

## Features:

- Interactive CLI prompts
- Two input modes (basic or with additional details)
- Custom stop-words to end input session
- Neat and numbered output formatting

## How to use?:  

1. Open the `.exe` file or `.py` file.

2. Choose mode: 1 = main info only; 2 = main + additional info.

3. To stop input, type: stop, enough, yes, or -.

4. The script will output your entries as a formatted, numbered list.

### I have completed this project. If I find errors, I will fix them as small fixes. However, they should not be.
